# 3D Rotating Cube Terminal Animation Explained

This code creates a 3D rotating cube animation that renders in the terminal using ASCII characters. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

## Core Concepts

### 3D Projection
The animation uses a technique called 3D projection to display a 3D object (cube) on a 2D screen (terminal). It transforms 3D coordinates (x, y, z) into 2D screen coordinates (xp, yp).

### Z-Buffer
To handle depth perception, the program uses a z-buffer (depth buffer). This ensures that surfaces closer to the viewer appear in front of surfaces that are farther away.

## Key Components

### Variables
- `A`, `B`, `C`: Rotation angles for the cube around different axes
- `width`, `height`: Dimensions of the terminal display area
- `zBuffer`: Stores depth information for each pixel
- `buffer`: Stores the ASCII character to display at each position
- `distanceFromCam`: Distance between the viewer and the cube
- `K1`: Projection constant that affects perspective

### Mathematical Transformations

Three core functions handle the 3D transformations:

1. `calculateX()`: Computes the x-coordinate after rotation and projection
2. `calculateY()`: Computes the y-coordinate after rotation and projection
3. `calculateZ()`: Computes the z-coordinate after rotation

These functions use trigonometric operations (sine and cosine) to rotate the cube in 3D space.

### Surface Rendering

The `calculateForSurface()` method:
1. Transforms 3D coordinates using the rotation functions
2. Calculates screen coordinates using perspective projection
3. Calculates depth (z-coordinate)
4. Updates the display buffer if the current point is closer to the viewer than previously rendered points

### Animation Loop

The main loop:
1. Clears the buffer
2. Updates rotation angles
3. Renders each cube surface
4. Outputs the updated frame to the terminal
5. Adds a short delay to control the animation speed

## Rendering Process

1. Six surfaces of the cube are created by iterating through a range of coordinates
2. Each surface uses a different ASCII character (`@`, `$`, `~`, `#`, `;`, `+`)
3. The surfaces are rendered to the buffer by calculating which points are visible
4. ANSI escape codes clear the screen and position the cursor
5. The buffer is displayed, creating the animation frame

## Technical Details

- The program uses perspective projection where objects farther away appear smaller
- Rotation is continuously updated to create the spinning effect
- The z-buffer ensures proper occlusion (objects in front block objects behind)
- Terminal control is handled with ANSI escape sequences
- Frame rate is controlled with a sleep timer

This animation demonstrates fundamental computer graphics concepts like 3D transformations, perspective projection, and hidden surface removal, all within the constraints of a text-based terminal.
